# Project Microculture

Every project has different requirements and principles. This should result in a different engineering philosophy per project, with each philosophy focusing on what really matters for the project at hand. Whether or not this happens on other projects, it is definintely happening here.

In addition to an engineering philosophy, every project should have a set of rules, protocols, and expected behaviors for the people involved. These things, coupled with the engineering philosophy, form a tiny little culture (a microculture) that drives the way people interact with each other and with the project iteself.

In order to contribute to ioFog, you must buy into the project's microculture entirely.

A good way to capture the essence of a microculture is to put it in the form of belief statements. The statements may be refined or changed over time by the microculture administrator (usually the owner of the project) in order to serve the project better. For the most part, however, the statements are stable and should be treated as the project's code of conduct.

### Our Microculture Statements (in no particular order)

* We use the minimal amount of code for the job
* We believe that nobody will ever reuse our classes so we code for our own efficiency
* We comment code well enough that we don't have to read the code to know what it does
* We use the simplest and most direct approach for every task
* We keep the number of 3rd party libraries and dependencies to an absolute minimum
* We write very protective code that handles all exception types instead of throwing errors
* We avoid writing any build tool dependencies into the actual code base
* We write great performance tests and unit tests so we can evaluate quality on many levels at build time
* We choose to write fast executing code over code that's easy to write and maintain
* We talk openly about what is not working or where we need help
* We engineer with a focus on the long term quality and reliability of the project
* We are always available at the scheduled times so we can rely on each other as team members
* We teach each other when we know more
* We learn from each other when we know less
* We try to use standard practices for each language and framework so nobody has to spend time figuring out our techniques
* We respect each other's ideas and we listen to them fully before responding
